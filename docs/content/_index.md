# Apache Paimon

Apache Paimon(incubating) is a streaming data lake platform that supports high-speed data ingestion, change data tracking and efficient real-time analytics.

Paimon offers the following core capabilities:

- Unified Batch & Streaming: Paimon supports batch write and batch read, as well as streaming write changes and streaming read table changelogs.
- Data Lake: As a data lake storage, Paimon has the following advantages: low cost, high reliability, and scalable metadata.
- Merge Engines: Paimon supports rich Merge Engines. By default, the last entry of the primary key is reserved. You can also use the "partial-update" or "aggregation" engine.
- Changelog producer: Paimon supports rich Changelog producers, such as "lookup" and "full-compaction". The correct changelog can simplify the construction of a streaming pipeline.
- Append Only Tables: Paimon supports Append Only tables, automatically compact small files, and provides orderly stream reading. You can use this to replace message queues.
